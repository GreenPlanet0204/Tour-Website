These relaxed sightseeing rides show you the entire town! Afterwards, you will not only have loads of #instacool photos, but also a completely fresh take on what to do in Dubrovnik! Coupled with sleek Mercedes Benz Sprinters and wind in your hair, our rides just might be the best hour and a half around here. ",

If the regular delivery of goods during a certain period has been contracted, the period mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article starts with the day the Consumer or a third person determined by the Consumer who is not a carrier has come into possession of the first piece or the first delivery of goods. In the case of conclusion of a service contract the period mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article starts with the day the contract is concluded. If the Trader has not informed the Consumer about their right to unilateral termination of the contract, the Consumer's right to unilateral contract termination expires 12 months after the termination deadline from Article 72 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act. If the Trader has notified the Consumer of the right mentioned in the previous paragraph of this Article within 12 months of the deadlines determined in Article 72 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, the Consumer's right to unilateral contract termination from Article 72 of the Consumer Protection Act expires within14 days from the day the Consumer has received such notification. The Consumer shall inform the Trader about their decision to terminate the contract prior to expiration of the deadline for unilateral contract termination by way of a unilateral contract termination form or by way of any other unambiguous statement expressing the will to terminate the contract. The form and content of the form mentioned in the previous paragraph of this Article is stipulated by the Minister in charge of consumer protection by way of ordinance. If the Trader, on their website, allows for the possibility of unilateral contract termination by the Consumer, the Consumer can unilaterally terminate the contract by completing a unilateral contract termination form or any other unambiguous termination statement and sending it to the Trader electronically.  In the case mentioned in the previous paragraph of this Article the Trader shall, without delay, send a confirmation of the receipt of such termination statement in a durable medium. The Consumer shall send the contract termination statement prior to expiration of the deadline for contract termination provided for in Articles 72 and 73 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act.  The Consumer shall prove that they have realized their right to unilateral contract termination pursuant to the provisions of this Article. If the Consumer exercises the right to unilateral contract termination from Article 72 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, the parties are not required to fulfil their obligations from the contract concluded outside business premises or from the distance contract, respectively, if the offer to conclude a contract was made by the Consumer, the parties are not obliged to conclude a contract. In the event of contract termination, every party is required to return to the other party what they have received on the basis of the contract, pursuant to the provisions of this Article. The Consumer is not required to cover expenses which might result from exercising the right to unilateral contract termination from Article 72 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, except for those provided for in the following paragraphs of the General Terms.

The Trader shall refund payments made using the same means of payment used by the Consumer, except if the Consumer explicitly agrees to another means of payment, and provided that the Consumer will not be required to cover any other additional costs for such refund. Unless the Trader has offered to be the one to take over the goods the Consumer is returning, the Consumer is required to return the goods without delay and no later than within 14 days of the day they notified the Trader, pursuant to Article 74 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, about their decision to terminate the contract.

The Consumer shall only bear the direct costs of returning goods unless the Trader has agreed to bear these costs or if the Trader has neglected to inform the Consumer that they are required to bear these costs. If, in case of a contract concluded outside business premises, at the moment of contract conclusion the goods were delivered to the Consumer's home, the Trader shall take over the goods at their own expense if, because of the nature of the goods, it is not possible to return them via regular mail. The Consumer is liable for every decrease in value of the goods resulting from handling them, except for the handling necessary to identify the nature, features and functionalities of the goods. By way of derogation from the previous paragraph of this Article, if the Trader has not informed the Consumer of their right to unilateral contract termination pursuant to Article 57, item 8 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, the Consumer is not liable for a decrease in value of the goods, whatever the cause for such decrease in value might be.

In case of unilateral service contract termination the Consumer shall not be required to pay for a part of the price proportional to what was provided for the Consumer by the Trader during the period before expiration of the deadline for unilateral contract termination if the Trader did not deliver the notifications provided for by the provisions of Article 57, paragraph 1, items 8 and 10 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, and respectively if the Consumer has not, pursuant to Articles 64 and 70 of the Croatian Consumer Protection Act, explicitly demanded services to be provided before expiration of the deadline for unilateral contract termination. If the consumer unilaterally terminates the contract pursuant to the provisions of this Article, all other connected contracts shall be terminated, and without any costs for the Consumer except for the ones provided for by the provisions of this Article. The Consumer is not entitled to unilateral contract termination from this Article if: 1.the service contract has been completely fulfilled by the Trader and fulfilment started with the explicit consent of the Consumer and their confirmation to be familiar with the fact that they will lose the right to unilateral contract termination from this article if the service will be provided in full., 2. goods or services whose price depends on changes on the financial market which the Trader is unable to influence, and which can occur during the period in which the Consumer is entitled to unilateral contract termination, are the subject of the contract, 3. goods which are tailor-made for the Consumer or which are clearly adapted to the Consumer are the subject of the contract, 4. the Consumer has specifically demanded the Trader's visit for the purpose of emergency repairs or maintenance work, but if, in the event of such visit, apart from the services that the Consumer has explicitly demanded, the Trader provides other services, that is, delivers other goods besides the ones necessary for performing emergency repairs and maintenance work, the Consumer is entitled to unilateral contract termination related to such additional services or goods. 5. accommodation services which are not aimed at permanent housing, services of transporting goods, services of renting vehicles, services of delivery of food and beverages or services related to leisure are subject of the contract, if such services were contracted to be delivered at a specific date or during a specific period.
